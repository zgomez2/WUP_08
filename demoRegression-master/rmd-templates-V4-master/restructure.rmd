## Suppose you have a dataframe with the columns being numeric measurements of various features of interest.  Also suppose 
## you want to run a one-way anova between these features - you can use gather, melt, or stack - we use a data frame from  
## the internet with football player weights

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
mydata <- read.csv("FootBallTeams.csv")
ydata <- mydata %>% select(-dallas)
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyr)
dat <- gather(mydata, variable, value) 
dat$variable <-as.factor(dat$variable)
# note explicit use of as.factor
```
```{r}
require(reshape2)
dat2 <- melt(mydata)
dat3 <- melt(mydata,id.vars = c(4),variable.name = "whichOnes") # id.vars - weird option
```

```{r}
require(stats)
noDenver <-stack(mydata,select=-Denver)                   

```
